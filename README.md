How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure this by following the given requirements and parameters by the client or assignment for the software. Going by the requrements and then testing the software will make sure it is fucntional.
If there are any errors it will be checked again and revised, making sure to reach atleats above a 80% coverage when testing.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I take what the user wants and try to incpororate them into the code as exactly as possibly, then revising the code to make it functional and provide much testing to ensure accuracy as mentioned above. I take the users needs and have them as the requirements
I must abide by when creating the code. 

How do I approach designing software?

I apprach designing software with the client's needs in mind. If the project does not mean company or client's standards then it is not usable even if functional. So the requirements of the software is used first
and developed first, then it is revised to be functional and work effectively without error. The needs of the code comes first then the revision.
